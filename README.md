# chirp_keograms

The algorithms in this repository can be used to make Range-Time-Intensity plots or keograms from the HF observations made by the ionospheric sounding mode of the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) in Scranton, Pennsylvania currently implemented on an Ettus N200 Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) using the open source GNU Chirpsounder data collection and analysis code chirpsounder2.
